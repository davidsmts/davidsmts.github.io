## 🧠 Interest: AI Safety & LLM Robustness

I am deeply interested in AI Safety, with a special focus on the robustness and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). My current research explores how LLMs can be made more robust to adversarial prompts, distributional shifts, and unexpected behaviors, ensuring they are trustworthy and safe for real-world deployment.
