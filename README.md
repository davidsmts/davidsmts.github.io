## 🧠 Interest: AI Safety & LLM Robustness

My work is driven by the belief that as AI systems become more powerful and widespread, ensuring their safety and reliability becomes increasingly critical for society.

Some topics I am looking into at the moment:

**Privacy and Information Security**: I am interested in understanding how sensitive information flows through AI systems and developing methods to better protect user data while maintaining model utility.

**AI System Interactions and Safety**: I explore how AI systems behave when they interact with each other and how potential vulnerabilities or biases might propagate through networks of interconnected models.

**Robustness and Performance Trade-offs**: I am curious about novel approaches to balancing safety guarantees with model performance, particularly through innovative training methodologies, optimization techniques and noise design.
